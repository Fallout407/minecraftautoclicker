# Minecraft Autoclicker
An extremely basic C++ autoclicker for Minecraft.
Anyone with basic programming knowledge can do this, it's nothing special.
People keep reviewing autoclickers on Minecraft cheating channels, but unless it has some special feature, it's just a basic autoclicker. (I am not trying to diss autoclickers, I actually like autoclickers with special features. It's just that some are super basic)
If you don't know how to make a basic autoclicker in C++, feel free to learn from this code!
